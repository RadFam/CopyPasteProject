# QT/QML CopyPaste Desctop App

This is a small desctop application, that provides an opportunity to make multi copy-paste actions by
copying text data from clipboard, and pasting it back from app TextEdit to clipboard.

This program uses model-view-delegate pattern, where model was realised in c++ class (inherited from QAbstractListModel)/
And Delegate - TextEdit component, COPY and PASTE button was made as a QML object

You can copy text data to clipboard to the appropriate textedit field, by several ways:
- directly copy text (ctrl+c) from TextEdit field
- press button "COPY" under appropriate TextEdit field
- use shortcut "Ctrl+n", where n is the number of needed TextEdit field (numeration of fields is 1,2,3,4,5)

Paste of data to clipboard can be implemented also by three ways:
- directly paste (ctrl+v) to TextEdit field
- press button "PASTE" under appropriate TextEdit field
- use shortcut "Alt+n", where n is the number of needed TextEdit field (numeration of fields is 1,2,3,4,5)

When the application starts, every TextEdit already has "QWERTY" word, this is normal :)
